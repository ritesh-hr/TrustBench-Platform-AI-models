    "response": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Explained Simply:\nMulti-factor authentication is like having multiple locks on your door instead of just one key. It's a security system that requires you to prove your identity in two or more different ways before accessing your account.\nThe Three Types of \"Factors\":\nSomething you know - Password, PIN, security question\nSomething you have - Phone, security key, authentication app\nSomething you are - Fingerprint, face scan, voice recognition\nReal-World Example:\nWhen you log into your bank account:\nYou enter your password (something you know)\nThe bank sends a code to your phone (something you have)\nYou enter that code to complete login\nEven if someone steals your password, they can't access your account without also having your phone.\nCommon MFA Methods:\nSMS codes - Text message with a code\nAuthentication apps - Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Authy\nPush notifications - Approve login on your phone\nBiometrics - Fingerprint or face recognition\nHardware keys - Physical USB security keys\nEmail codes - Code sent to your email\nWhy It Matters:\nAdds a critical second layer of protection\nMakes stolen passwords nearly useless to hackers\nSignificantly reduces the risk of account breaches\nThink of it as: Even if someone has your house key (password), they still need your fingerprint (second factor) to get in.",
